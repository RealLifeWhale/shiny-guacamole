# Hello There!



For starters... you need __SDL2__ and __SDL2 Image__

So I'm gunna try to make a cpp game with a custom game engine cause why not, eh? ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

So for starters the game engine is gunna be cross platform. I'm developing it on linux and will use MinGW to compile to windows. You'll need SDL2.dll and SDL2_image.dll. I'd like to do OSX but I dont have a mac.

I want to learn Networking and will prob stay with SDL for that cause... well, they have a lib for everything. So you might need SDL_net.dll on wondows of just the package from your package manager or whatever. lol, I'll figure it out

I'm think I'm going to use SDL2 SDL_Net SDL_Image etc. If y'all have a better idea, please let me know... I dont know what I'm doing.
