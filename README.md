# Hello There!

So I'm gunna try to make a cpp game with a custom game engine ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

So for starters the game engine is gunna be cross platform. I'm developing it on linux and will use MinGW to compile to windows. I'd like to do OSX but I dont have a mac.

I want to learn Networking and will prob stay with SDL for that cause... well, they have a lib for everything.

I'm think I'm going to use SDL2 SDL_Net SDL_Image etc. If y'all have a better idea, please let me know... I dont know what I'm doing.
